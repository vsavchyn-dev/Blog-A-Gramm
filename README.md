# Blog-A-Gramm

**Hello!**

Welcome to **Blog-A-Gramm** - my implementation of the blog service "web-application".\
Nevertheless, be sure to pull the repo and check it out! Maybe it's not that impressive, but it is the most functional web app I built (maybe, check my other repos to prove me wrong!). And I like it, so definitely check it out!

### Cyclic Link to touch application: [Not available ;(](https://github.com/vsavchyn-dev/Blog-A-Gramm)
[_Some rats_](https://youtu.be/51Vek_n8msQ?si=sh4ncyGeXKAsiFTe) ate the cables for the internet, so I need a little bit of time to find new ones, sorry!

## Available Commands
### npm start
Starts server, which will be accessible via localhost. Even so, you need a MongoDB and PostgreSQL servers to run it :| So click on the link to touch the application.

### npm test
Doesn't work, everything was tested on-site (will add eslint default tests, later).
